  <h1>Watch Me React App</h1>
</div>

First install the dependencies:

```
npm i
```

Then run the server:

```
npm start
```

After the above command, the application will be available in: `http://localhost:8080`

For the application to be working perfectly, it is necessary to run the api first, for that [click here](../api-json-server/README.md)
